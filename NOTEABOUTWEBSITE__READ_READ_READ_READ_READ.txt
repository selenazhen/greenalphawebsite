Professor Stanton,

Hope you are doing well!

First off, I want to sincerely apologize for turning this in late... it was absolutely not my intention, and I do take the blame for not starting earlier. I'm an architecture major and this semester has been one of my busiest and difficult yet. (I'm sure its not going to get any better either) I honestly regret not putting more time forward for this class specifically because web design is something that I really enjoy doing. (and am considering for a minor???)

That being said, this website is a little different than what I was going to do originally, and had already started on, which was an online portfolio. However, I realized that I wanted to give my parents a bit of an early christmas present and help them out with something that their business has been seriously lacking: a website. So what I turning is is more of a "shell" of what I want the website to become, especially because I haven't gotten a chance to make all of the product pages yet (theres a lot!).

Some issues that I know i'm missing
-something is wrong with my form and for the life of me, I cannot figure it out...
-also the banner on the form

Have a lovely winter and happy holidays!
